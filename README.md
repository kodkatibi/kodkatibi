### Hi there 👋

🚀 Passionate Software Developer | Laravel Enthusiast | Back-end Developer 🚀

🎓 Proud graduate of YTU with a degree in Business.

💻 Since 2014, I've been captivated by the world of software development, with PHP becoming my true love in 2017. Thanks to Laravel, masterfully crafted by Taylor Otwell, my passion for PHP soared to new heights.

🛠️ Proficient in a variety of technologies, including Yii, Core PHP, Node.js (especially for Websocket applications), and Vue.js (a framework I've grown fond of despite my initial reservations about JavaScript).

🗃️ Experienced in working with databases, with a strong command of MySQL, along with hands-on experience with Redis, MSSQL, and MongoDB.

☁️ Familiar with AWS services such as EC2, ECS, and EKS, with a keen interest in cloud computing.

🐳 Docker aficionado - leveraging containerization to streamline development and deployment processes.

☕ Additionally, I have a fondness for Java and C#, adding versatility to my skill set.

🧠 A quick learner who thrives on understanding the core principles of any subject.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family-oriented professional - married with one child and committed to achieving a healthy work-life balance.

📚 Eager to explore and embrace new disciplines, constantly seeking opportunities for growth and innovation.

🚶‍♂️ I find my best ideas during long walks, where I enjoy the mental clarity that comes from physical activity.
