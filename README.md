### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm getting straight to the point:
- I'm a YTU business graduate candidate, it's almost over.
- I fell in love with software in 2014, and PHP has been the master of my heart since 2017.
- It was Laravel that made me love PHP. (Thanks Taylor Otwell)
- In addition, I wrote Yii and Core PHP.
- I wrote Node.js for Websocket. I used Vue for a project. Normally I wouldn't like JS, but I've warmed up to Vue.
- I used Redis, MSSQL, and MongoDB for the DB, mostly MYSQL. I am confident in MYSQL. I'm not bad at using Redis either.
- I also used AWS. At least I know what EC2, ECS, EKS, etc are.
- If you ask whether it is Back-end or Front-end, my answer will be Back-end.
- Docker is our red line.
- I like Java and C# too.
- I learn quickly as long as the essence of the matter is conveyed well.
- I am married and I have one child.
- I like to learn and try a new discipline.
- I like to think. I think better while walking. I like long walks.
